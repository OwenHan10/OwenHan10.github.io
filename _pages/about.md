Selected News & Experience
======

PhD Study
------
My PhD study focus more on the general applications of radar. Compared to my master's study, my research topic extended from specific range bin data analysis to global detection, tracking, and target association. The research methodology also evolved from purely real-world data processing to include simulation and processing. Additionally, the type of radar expanded from monostatic to MIMO, and from UWB radar only to UWB and all types of FMCW radar. Consequently, the data processed extended from 1-dimensional points to 3-dimensional point clouds (Last update Mar. 2024).

PhD Comprehensive Exam
------
In 2023, to better achieve my research goals for my PhD, my supervisor and I developed a curriculum plan. I prepared for and successfully passed the relevant PhD comprehensive exams, focusing on Radar Signal Processing, Biomedical Signal Analysis, and Artificial Neural Networks.

Lab2Market
------
In spring and summer 2022, I participated in the [Lab2Market program](https://www.lab2market.ca/) organized by NSERC. With funding from NSERC and guidance from program organizers, I conducted market research on the indoor radar monitoring technology I had been working on. This involved designing and distributing online questionnaires, reaching out to and interviewing stakeholders, developing a business model, and producing both a market research report and an elevator pitch presentation. The elevator pitch presentation video is available at [here](https://owenhan10.github.io/talks/2022-06-30-L2M-Pitch).

Hospital Project
------
After I joined the HDRG, our research group initiated the research program that uses radar to monitor heart failure patient long-term vitals in Winter 2019 at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) [link](http://health-devices.site.uottawa.ca/research.html#heart_failure). We designed and developed the initial prototype of our experimental device and commenced data collection in the summer of 2019. The prototype included an Intel Realsense Depth Camera and a Novelda Xethru X4 UWB radar. The depth camera was utilized to collect ground truth image data, monitoring patient activities within the designated zone without capturing facial details. The project was suspended in Winter 2020 due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed in Winter 2023. During the suspension, I redesigned the entire device, replacing the depth camera with a thermal sensor to ensure enhanced image quality while maintaining patient anonymity. The devices are currently still in use. We collected 48-hour data from volunteer patients under the supervision of collaborating doctors, with 15 heart failure patients currently participating in our study. Additionally, in 2019, we installed our data collection device at the Perly Health Center and obtained data from one senior volunteer [link](http://health-devices.site.uottawa.ca/research.html#nursing_homes). The experimental methodology and findings of this research will be published in mid-2024." 

<!-- In the first year of my graduate studies, my supervisor Prof. Miodrag Bolic offered me an opportunity to work on a project at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) that involved using radar to collect and analyze the vital signs of congestive heart failure patients. Collaborating with members of our Health Device Research Group (HDRG), we designed and developed the initial prototype of our experimental device and began data collection in the summer of 2019. The prototype included an Intel Realsense Depth Camera and a Novelda Xethru X4 UWB radar. The depth camera was used to collect ground truth image data, monitoring patient activities within the designated zone without capturing facial details.

Developing IoT Device
------
In 2021 fall, I developed front and back-end systems that work with hospital collection devices, upgrading the hospital data collection system to an IoT system. Users can now access and upload data through an Android app. The system features three user identities: administrator, doctor, and client, each with distinct access and operation privileges. More details of the IoT system is available at [here](https://owenhan10.github.io/portfolio/Radar_IoT/)."

Real-Time Radar Indoor Monitoring System
------
Between 2021 and 2022, HDRG engineered a real-time indoor monitoring system comprising a Kinect camera and three radars to track the location, respiration rate, and breathing patterns of multiple individuals in all directions. The system comprises a Kinect camera for target localization and radar signal selection, and three radar sensors for respiratory rate estimation and respiratory pattern classification. Our system was featured in the journal Frontier, with my primary contribution lying in the development of radar signal processing algorithms and the integration and testing of the system. More details of the system is available at [here](https://owenhan10.github.io/portfolio/RP_classify/).

Master Thesis
------
For my master's thesis completed in 2021, I developed a simulation model for abnormal respiratory patterns, implemented shapelet-based time series classification for respiratory pattern recognition, and created high-precision and high-recall models for real-time implementation and long-term analysis, respectively. The thesis document can be accessed [here](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/items/cc1b9f82-4843-457d-96ad-a7804326e156).

Graduate Study
------
During my master's studies, I specialized in respiratory signal analysis, focusing on vital signs extraction from radar signals, signal quality assessment, and identification of abnormal respiratory patterns using time-domain features. As a second author, I contributed to a conference paper published in EMBC 2020, wherein I developed an algorithm to evaluate the quality of collected breathing signals and validated the effectiveness of my coauthor's body tracking method. The paper is available at [here](https://owenhan10.github.io/publication/2022-03-09-Frontier-Journal).

Undergrad Thesis
------
I completed my undergraduate thesis in Jun. 2018 under the supervision of Prof. Jianhui Wang (author of Principles of Automatic Control, Chinese Version). In this thesis, I developed an EMG-based gait cycle phase classification model. This involved collecting 4-channel EMG signals from muscles including the rectus femoris, hamstring, tibialis anterior tendon, and gastrocnemius to predict gait phases. The objective was to explore the control scheme of assisting lower-limb exoskeletons. This work received the Excellent Bachelor Thesis Award from the College of Information Science and Engineering at Northeastern University.

<!-- In my final year of undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at Neusoft, one of the largest IT service provider companies in China. I was assigned to the Neusoft Medical Laboratory Information System sector and worked as an onsite software engineer in two hospitals: a Provincial Cancer Center and a Municipal General Hospital. My responsibilities involved the operation and maintenance of the lab information system, which managed lab test results independently of the hospital information system.

My experience at the Cancer Center was profoundly impactful. Accessing patient test data, I witnessed the heartbreaking reality of numerous cancer diagnoses, regardless of age. Each patient represents a story of love and loss; they are cherished family members or friends, and many of them are no longer able to walk out of the hospital door. Beyond the gates, desperate relatives paced, unable to afford treatment and vulnerable to counterfeit cures. My time at the municipal general hospital provided a broader perspective. While updating hardwares, I got chances to worked in various hospital departments. From the somber atmosphere of the dialysis unit to the hopeful environment of the Neonatal unit, each encounter left a lasting impact.

This internship experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in healthcare, leveraging my background in electrical and computer engineering to make a difference. Subsequently, I was offered admission to the University of Ottawa, a prestigious medical doctoral university located in Canada's capital, renowned for its close ties to local hospitals and research labs. With gratitude, I accepted the offer, eager to begin my graduate studies and contribute to health care industry. -->
