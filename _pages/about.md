I am a currently PhD Candidate in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of Ottawa, serving as a Research Assistant in the [Health Device Research Group (HDRG)](http://health-devices.site.uottawa.ca/) supervised by [Prof. Miodrag Bolic](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~mbolic/). I received my Master of Applied Science degree from University of Ottawa in the same research group in 2021. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Northeastern University (China) in 2021. I was a varsity athlete who played for the Northeastern University men's soccer team in 2017-2018.

Research Interest
------
My research interests are in wireless sensing, healthcare and applied machine learning.



Selected Experience
======
Varsity Athelete Career
------
I served as the Captain of the Information Science and Engineering College Men's Soccer Team during the 2016 and 2017 seasons, playing as a midfielder. I secured support from our college, raised funds to rebuild our team, participated in the management of day-to-day operations, and led the team to the final tournament every year. In 2017-2018, I was selected to play for our University men's soccer team and competed in municipal, provincial, and international high-level games. Additionally, I have been awarded University Scholarships and athlete bursaries since 2017.

Hospital onsite engineer internship experience
------
In my final year of undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at Neusoft, one of the largest IT service provider companies in China. I was assigned to the Neusoft Medical Laboratory Information System sector and worked as an onsite software engineer in two hospitals: a Provincial Cancer Center and a Municipal General Hospital. My responsibilities involved the operation and maintenance of the lab information system, which managed lab test results independently of the hospital information system.

My experience at the Cancer Center was profoundly impactful. Accessing patient test data, I witnessed the heartbreaking reality of numerous cancer diagnoses, regardless of age. Each patient represents a story of love and loss; they are cherished family members or friends, and many of them are no longer able to walk out of the hospital door. Beyond the gates, desperate relatives paced, unable to afford treatment and vulnerable to counterfeit cures.

My time at the municipal general hospital provided a broader perspective. While updating hardwares, I got chances to worked in various hospital departments. From the somber atmosphere of the dialysis unit to the hopeful environment of the Neonatal unit, each encounter left a lasting impact.

This internship experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in healthcare, leveraging my background in electrical and computer engineering to make a difference. Subsequently, I was offered admission to the University of Ottawa, a prestigious medical doctoral university located in Canada's capital, renowned for its close ties to local hospitals and research labs. With gratitude, I accepted the offer, eager to begin my graduate studies and contribute to health care industry.

Undergrad thesis
------
After completing the internship, I needed to complete my thesis to graduate. Fortunately, I was selected by my undergraduate supervisor, Prof. Jianhui Wang, who is renowned as the author of Principles of Automatic Control (Chinese Version). Under her guidance and support, I developed an EMG-based gait cycle phase classification model. This involved collecting 4-channel EMG signals from muscles including the rectus femoris, hamstring, tibialis anterior tendon, and gastrocnemius to predict gait phases. The objective was to explore the control scheme of assisting lower-limb exoskeletons. This work received the Excellent Bachelor Thesis Award from the College of Information Science and Engineering at Northeastern University.

Hospital Project
------
In the first year of my graduate studies, my supervisor Prof. Miodrag Bolic offered me an opportunity to work on a project at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) that involved using radar to collect and analyze the vital signs of congestive heart failure patients. Collaborating with members of our Health Device Research Group (HDRG), we designed and developed the initial prototype of our experimental device and began data collection in the summer of 2019. The prototype included an Intel Realsense Depth Camera and a Novelda Xethru X4 UWB radar. The depth camera was used to collect ground truth image data, monitoring patient activities within the designated zone without capturing facial details. However, the project was suspended due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, we resumed the project, and I redesigned the entire device, replacing the depth camera with a thermal sensor to ensure enhanced image quality while maintaining patient anonymity. We collected 48-hour data from volunteer patients under the supervision of collaborating doctor, with 15 heart failure patients currently participating in our study. Additionally, in 2019, we installed our data collection device at the Perly Health Center and obtained data from one senior volunteer. The experiment method and findings of this research will be published in mid-2024.

Graduate Study
------
During my study in the Master of Applied Science program, I focused on the respiratory signal analysis including vital signs extraction from radar signal, signal quality evaluation and abnormal respiratory pattern identification based on time-domain features. I published a conference paper in EMBC 2020 as a second author based on the hospital project research, and my main contribution is develop an algorithm to evaluate the collected breathing signal's quality and prove my coauthor's work of body tracking works well. The paper can be found here.

My master thesis (2021) is about developing a abnormal respiratory pattern simulation model, implement shapelet-based time series classification in respiratory pattern classification and develop a high-precision and a high-recall model. The thesis can be found here.

PhD Study
------
In 2021 fall, I developed front and back-end systems that work with hospital collection devices, upgrading the hospital data collection system to an IoT system where users can access and upload data through an Android app. The system has three identities of administrator, doctor and customer with different access and operation privileges. The demo of the system can be found at address.

During 2021-2022, we developed a real-time indoor monitoring system consisting of a Kinect as well as three radars to monitor the location, respiration rate, and breathing patterns of multiple people in all directions. The system consists of a Kinect camera for target localization and radar signal selection, and radars for respiratory rate estimation and respiratory pattern classification. The system was published in the journal Frontier. My main contribution was to provide radar signal processing algorithms and the integration and testing of the system. The demo of the system can be found at address.

In the spring and summer of 2022, I was selected for the Lab2Market program organized by NSERC, and completed market research on the indoor radar monitoring technology I was working on with funding from NSERC and guidance from the project organizers, which included designing and distributing online questionnaires, outreaching and interviewing stakeholders, building a business model, and writing a market research report as well as a elevator pitch presentation.

 In 2023, I studied and passed the PhD Comprehensive Exam in Radar Signal Processing, Biomedical Signal Analysis, and Artificial Neural Networks in order to prepare myself for the next phase of my research.


**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
