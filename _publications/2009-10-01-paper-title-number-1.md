excerpt: 'We present a novel respiratory signal detection system capable of simultaneously tracking the subject's position and detecting their respiratory signal. The monitoring system comprises a depth camera and an ultra-wideband radar device, both connected to a mini-computer for data acquisition and storage. In this paper, we propose a method to locate the subject's position when lying in bed under a blanket. We employ Mask R-CNN to segment the upper body silhouette and determine the center point distance. This distance is then converted into a range bin of the radar, from which the breath-like signal is extracted. Additionally, we developed a classifier to discern whether the extracted signal in the selected range bin corresponds to a breathing signal or not.'
