excerpt: 'A novel respiratory signal detection system capable of simultaneously tracking the position of the subject and detecting his or her respiratory signal is described. The monitoring system consists of depth camera with ultra wide band radar device. Both sensors are connected through a mini computer, which performs data acquisition and storage. In this paper, we propose a method to locate the position of the subject where he or she is lying in the bed covered with blanket. Mask R-CNN is used to help segment upper-body's silhouette and give out the center point distance. The distance between the camera and the subject is then converted into a range bin of the radar and the breath-like signal is extracted from that range- bin. Additional contribution of this paper is that we developed a classifier to classify the whether the extracted signal in the selected range bin is indeed a breathing signal or not.'

<!-- Respiration rate (RR) and respiration patterns (RP) are considered early indicators of physiological conditions and cardiorespiratory diseases. In this study, we addressed the problem of contactless estimation of RR and classification of RP of one person or two persons in a confined space under realistic conditions. We used three impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) radars and a 3D depth camera (Kinect) to avoid any blind spot in the room and to ensure that at least one of the radars covers the monitored subjects. This article proposes a subject localization and radar selection algorithm using a Kinect camera to allow the measurement of the respiration of multiple people placed at random locations. Several different experiments were conducted to verify the algorithms proposed in this work. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the estimated RR and reference RR of one-subject and two-subjects RR estimation are 0.61±0.53 breaths/min and 0.68±0.24 breaths/min, respectively. A respiratory pattern classification algorithm combining feature-based random forest classifier and pattern discrimination algorithm was developed to classify different respiration patterns including eupnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, Kussmaul respiration and apnea. The overall classification accuracy of 90% was achieved on a test dataset. Finally, a real-time system showing RR and RP classification on a graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented for monitoring two subjects. -->
